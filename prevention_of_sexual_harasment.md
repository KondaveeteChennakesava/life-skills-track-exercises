# Prevention of Sexual Harassment

### 1. What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment refers to any unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that causes a person to feel uncomfortable, offended, intimidated, or degraded. This can include:

* Unwanted physical contact such as touching, patting, or brushing against someone
* Sexually suggestive jokes, comments, or gestures
* Displaying sexually explicit materials like posters, images, or screensavers
* Making inappropriate remarks, sexual innuendos, or propositions
* Sending unsolicited sexual messages through email, chat, or social media
* Persistently asking someone out on a date after they’ve declined
* Staring, leering, or engaging in behavior that makes someone feel unsafe

Whether expressed verbally, physically, in writing, or visually, these actions can create a hostile and uncomfortable work environment.

### 2. What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

If I experience or witness an incident of sexual harassment:

* **Record the incident**: Write down key details like the date, time, location, individuals involved, and a clear account of what happened.
* **Report it to the Internal Committee (IC)** or the PoSH team, as outlined in the organization’s policy.
* **Offer support to the affected individual** if I am a witness, by encouraging them to report the incident or accompanying them if they wish.
* **Avoid spreading rumors or taking retaliatory actions** against anyone involved.
* **Maintain confidentiality** throughout the complaint and investigation process.

It is important to **raise your voice**, **respond without delay**, and **follow the formal procedures** established by the organization, such as reaching out to the Internal Committee or HR department.

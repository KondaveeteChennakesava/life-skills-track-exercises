1. I generally try to avoid using an aggressive communication style.

2. I might unintentionally switch to it when I’m under intense stress.

3. It can also happen when I feel someone is being unfair or disrespectful to me or others.

4. For example, if a team member consistently disregards group efforts or behaves irresponsibly, I may become more forceful while addressing the issue.

5. I understand that aggressive communication isn’t the most productive approach.

6. I’m actively working on managing my emotions better.

7. I strive to use assertive communication instead—expressing myself clearly but respectfully.

### Question 6 : When do you switch into Aggressive communication styles in your day to day life?

1. When I feel someone is being disrespectful or unfair, either to me or others.

2. In high-stress situations where emotions run high and patience wears thin.

3. When I face repeated negligence or irresponsibility from someone, especially in team settings.

4. If I believe that being firm and direct is the only way to be heard or taken seriously.

5. I’m aware that this isn’t ideal, so I consciously work on shifting toward assertive communication—being clear and firm, but still respectful.

### Question 7 : When do you switch into Passive Aggressive (sarcasm/gossiping/taunts/silent treatment and others) communication styles in your day to day life?

1. I try to avoid passive-aggressive behavior, but I sometimes slip into it when I feel unheard or dismissed repeatedly.

2. It may happen when I’m frustrated but don’t feel comfortable expressing my feelings directly.

3. For example, if someone takes credit for my work or doesn’t respect my time, I might become sarcastic or give short responses.

4. I’ve also noticed it when I expect others to notice an issue without me having to bring it up directly.

5. I understand that this style can harm relationships and create misunderstandings.

6. So, I’m making a conscious effort to be more open and assertive in expressing my thoughts and concerns respectfully.

##  Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg
**Question 1: What was the most interesting idea from Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg?**  
- In the video "Forget Big Change, Start with a Tiny Change: by BJ Fogg", I was got attached with the concept of celebration for tiny works. Starting from the video, I was completed hooked with the speaker. Explaining how to make tiny habits for the benefit of long term change. And I even noted down a quote called "When you know how to create a tiny change, you can change your life forever".
##  Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg - Core Message

**Question 2: How can you use B = MAP? What are M, A, and P?**  
- B = MAP.
where, B = Behavior, M = Motivation, A = Ability and P = Prompt.
What BJ Fogg was trying to  explain is, The behavior can be changed by these three aspects.
First, we need to  shrink our habit, so that it can be done within in less time.
Second, Do that tiny habit after a usual thing, where the usual thing will act as trigger to do the new tiny habit,
And last, Celebrate the small victory.
By using these concepts,  we can create a tiny habit which helps us to change our life forever.

**Question 3: Why is it important to "Shine" or celebrate after a habit?**  
- It is important to Shine or celebrate after a tiny habit. Because, it helps us to  do the same tiny habit again and again. So that, we can build up motivation to do it for a long term.
Depending on the external motivation, to create a habit will never work for long term. But by celebrating the small habit, we can achieve this change in the long term.

## 1% Better Every Day

**Question 4: What was the most interesting idea from 1% Better Every Day?**  
- The most interesting idea from the concept of “1% Better Every Day” by James Clear is how small, consistent improvements can lead to remarkable results over time. What really stayed with me was the idea that if you improve just 1% every day, you'll end up being 37 times better by the end of the year. This made me realize that habits don’t need to be massive or revolutionary, they just need to be consistent. The power lies in compounding, just like with money. Progress might feel invisible at first, but over time, it builds up and becomes undeniable. It inspired me to focus on making small, manageable changes rather than waiting for a perfect moment to make big ones.

## Atomic Habits

**Question 5: What does Atomic Habits say about identity?**  
- Atomic Habits emphasizes that true behavior change is identity change. Instead of focusing on goals like "I want to run a marathon," focus on becoming the type of person who runs: "I am a runner." When your habits reflect your identity, lasting change becomes easier and more natural.

**Question 6: How to make a habit easier to do?**  
- To make a habit easier, reduce the friction. Simplify the habit so it takes less time and effort. Start small, just 2 minutes is enough. Also, make your environment support the habit. For example, keep your workout clothes ready or place a book on your pillow to remind you to read.

**Question 7: How to make a habit harder to do?**  
- To make a habit harder, increase friction. Put obstacles in the way. For example, uninstall distracting apps, keep junk food out of sight, or log out of social media. The more effort it takes to start a bad habit, the less likely you’ll do it.
## Reflection

**Question 8: A habit I want to do more of**
- I want to improve my coding skills by practicing regularly. My goal is to solve at least one coding problem every day, even if it’s a small one. I plan to do this right after I finish my morning routine, so it becomes part of my daily flow. Over time, I believe this tiny habit will help me become more confident and consistent in programming.

**Question 9: A habit I want to do less of**  
- I want to spend less time playing the carrom game, as it often leads to wasting time. To avoid this, I’ll bring my coffee to my desk instead of drinking it near the game area. This will help me stay focused on my work and prevent unnecessary distractions.
